Hi there 👋. I am Svitlana Botiuk, and my basic education is electrical engineering 🎓. However, I am currently learning web programming, here is [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SeN8ct1nN83rJl0E-vd3FOrRjiCSWwYe/view?usp=sharing). Fun fact about me ☺️: I take photos 📷 and text 📄 reports on amateur sports competitions (mostly ⚽) and have been posting them on my [Facebook blog](https://facebook.com/fzvphoto) for over 5 years.
